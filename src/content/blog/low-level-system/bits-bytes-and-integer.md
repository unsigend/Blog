## Introduction

This blog post is a summary of CSAPP Chapter 2, covering fundamental concepts of how computers represent and manipulate data.

Computers represent all information as sequences of bits (0 or 1). A byte consists of 8 bits and serves as the basic unit of storage. **Unsigned integers** use standard binary encoding for non-negative values, while **signed integers** use two's complement representation to encode both positive and negative values.
