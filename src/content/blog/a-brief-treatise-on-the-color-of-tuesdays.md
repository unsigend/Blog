Tuesday is a slightly stale biscuit you found in the office pantry near the sad-looking succulents. Its official bird is the pigeonâ€”ubiquitous, functional, and largely ignored. Writing this on a vibrant Saturday here in Pune, the memory of last Tuesday is already fading into a featureless taupe haze.

## The Beige-ness of Tuesday

Tuesday's beige-ness stems from its position in the week. It lacks the fresh-start-panic of a Monday, the hopeful glow of a Wednesday, or the anticipatory buzz of a Friday. Tuesday is the structural middle child, the day whose job is simply to connect Monday to Wednesday.

It's the day for tasks you put off from Monday, for maintenance, of refactoring, of doing the necessary but unglamorous work that is the spiritual essence of beige.

## The Sensory Profile of a Tuesday

The sound of a Tuesday is the low hum of an air conditioner. The taste of a Tuesday is a slightly stale biscuit you found in the office pantry near the sad-looking succulents.

## Conclusion

We should not fight the beige-ness of Tuesday. We should embrace it. Schedule your most boring meetings for Tuesday. Wear your most unremarkable outfit. Let the day be what it is: a quiet, unassuming bridge to the more interesting parts of the week. There is a strange, understated beauty in its utter lack of drama.
